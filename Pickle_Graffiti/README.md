# Pickle Graffiti
*A program for conjecturing on simple graphs; an ode to Siemion Fajtlowicz and Rick Sanchez.*

### What is it?
Pickle_Graffiti is a automated conjecturing program. This program relies on
both heuristics and user interaction in order to produce graph theoretic
conjectures. This program has been heavily inspired by Siemion Fajtlowicz's Graffit and Ermelinda DeLaVina's Graffiti.pc.

NP-hard invariants in this version include:

* Chromatic number
* Clique number
* Independence number
* Domination number
* Total domination number
* Connected domination number
* Independent domination number
* Power domination number
* Zero forcing number
* Total zero forcing number
* Connected zero forcing number
* Minimum maximal matching number
* Generalized *k* versions of almost all of the above invariants

### Why does it exist?
The motivation for this project is to provide a simple program for
making conjectures on simple graphs.
